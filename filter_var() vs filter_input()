filter_var():
Purpose: Used for filtering and validating any variable (not limited to superglobals).
Functionality:
- Accepts any variable as input (e.g., a standalone variable, an expression, or a function result).
- Requires you to handle undefined variable errors yourself.
- Returns an empty string ("") if the variable doesn’t exist, along with a notice of an undefined index.
Example:
$foo = filter_var($_GET['foo'], FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);


filter_input():
Purpose: Specifically designed for retrieving and filtering external variables (from superglobals like $_GET, $_POST, etc.).
Functionality:
- Retrieves values directly from predefined superglobals (e.g., INPUT_GET, INPUT_POST).
- Returns NULL if the variable doesn’t exist, without generating an error.
- Independent of any modifications made to the superglobals during script execution.
Example:
$email = filter_input(INPUT_POST, '$_POST['email'], FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);
